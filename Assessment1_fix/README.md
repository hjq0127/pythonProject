# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Reading Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Jiaqin Hong

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`books.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`books_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code.
